  🎯 Key Features

  1. DuckDB Integration (Handles 9.2GB CSV)

  - Never loads full dataset into memory
  - Streaming SQL queries over CSV
  - Helper functions in duckdb_utils.py

  2. Google Colab Compatible

  - All notebooks have Drive mounting code (commented)
  - Sample generation for faster Colab work
  - Clear instructions for team collaboration

  3. Modular Workflow

  - 8 notebooks numbered for logical progression
  - Each can be worked on independently
  - Clear TODO sections for team to fill in

  4. Presentation-Focused

  - Competition judging criteria documented
  - Insight synthesis framework in notebook 08
  - Visualization templates with large fonts, colorblind palettes
  - Story structure guidance

  5. Team Collaboration Ready

  - Jupytext configuration for Git-friendly notebooks
  - Shared artifact strategy via Google Drive
  - Daily standup format in README
  - Role assignments suggested

  🚀 Next Steps for Your Team

  Immediate (Today):

  # 1. Verify environment
  source .venv/bin/activate
  python peek.py

  # 2. Generate 10% sample for fast iteration
  python create_sample.py --pct 10

  # 3. Start exploration
  jupyter notebook
  # Open: 00-setup-and-validation.ipynb

  For Google Colab Setup:

  1. Upload battles.csv to Google Drive: /MyDrive/DataRoyale/
  2. Upload generated artifacts/*.parquet files
  3. Share Drive folder with team
  4. Open notebooks, uncomment Drive mounting sections

  Analysis Workflow (Days 1-5):

  - Day 1 (Today): Setup, profiling, sample creation
  - Days 2-3: EDA in parallel (assign notebooks 02-04 to team members)
  - Day 4: Modeling + visualization
  - Day 5 (Friday): Presentation creation + practice

  📊 Competition Success Framework

  The workspace is optimized for the 5 judging criteria:

  1. Clarity & Storytelling → Notebook 08 provides story framework
  2. Data Understanding → Notebooks 01-04 guide thorough exploration
  3. Technical Rigor → Notebook 06 includes validation best practices
  4. Insights & Recommendations → Notebook 08 has "So What?" templates
  5. Visuals & Delivery → Notebook 07 has presentation-ready chart functions

  💡 High-Impact Analysis Ideas (from research)

  Priority insights to explore:
  1. Counter-meta discovery: Underused decks that beat popular ones
  2. Card synergy network: Which pairs have unexpected high win rates
  3. Trophy progression walls: Where players get stuck (e.g., 4000 trophies)
  4. Battle outcome prediction: Beat the 56.94% benchmark
  5. Elixir optimization: What's the sweet spot (likely 3.5-4.0)

  📝 Documentation Highlights

  - CLAUDE.md: Technical architecture + competition context
  - README.md: Complete team onboarding + troubleshooting
  - artifacts/README.md: Schemas for all intermediate files
  - docs/judging_rubric.md: Detailed scoring criteria + judge Q&A prep
