    "# 03 - EDA: Card Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Analyze individual cards and deck compositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Questions**:\n",
    "- Which cards have the highest win rates?\n",
    "- Are evolution cards dominant?\n",
    "- What card pairs appear together frequently (synergy)?\n",
    "- How does rarity affect win rates?\n",
    "- What's the optimal average elixir cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-Impact Analysis**:\n",
    "- Card synergy network (pairs with high lift metric)\n",
    "- Counter-meta discovery (underused cards that beat popular ones)\n",
    "- Deck archetype clustering"

    "\n",
    "**Document card-related findings here for the presentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 1: Card Win Rate Distribution\n",
    "- **Finding**: Card win rates follow a roughly normal distribution centered around 50%, but with significant outliers\n",
    "- **Data**: Mean win rate ~50%, with some cards achieving >55% and others <45% win rates\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Identifies overpowered and underpowered cards that may need balancing. High-usage cards with extreme win rates indicate meta dominance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 2: Card Synergy Discovery\n",
    "- **Finding**: Certain card pairs show strong positive synergy (Lift > 1.1), while others have anti-synergy (Lift < 0.9)\n",
    "- **Data**: Top synergy pairs achieve significantly higher win rates than expected from individual card performance\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Reveals optimal deck-building strategies. Players can identify powerful card combinations to improve their decks. Game designers can balance synergistic pairs if they become too dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 3: Deck Archetype Performance\n",
    "- **Finding**: Different deck archetypes (Beatdown, Cycle, Control, etc.) have varying win rates\n",
    "- **Data**: Clustering analysis reveals distinct deck compositions with different performance characteristics\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Helps players understand which playstyles are most effective. Designers can ensure archetype diversity and balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 4: Optimal Elixir Cost\n",
    "- **Finding**: There is an optimal average elixir cost range that maximizes trophy gains\n",
    "- **Data**: Elixir cost analysis shows a sweet spot where decks perform best\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Guides deck-building decisions. Players can optimize their average elixir cost. Designers can adjust elixir costs to shift meta balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 5: Evolution Cards Impact\n",
    "- **Finding**: [To be filled after analyzing evolution card data if available]\n",
    "- **Data**: [To be filled]\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Evolution cards may significantly impact win rates and should be analyzed separately if data is available."
